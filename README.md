#**Fish Market - Polynomial Regression**

## **Description**
This project uses polynomial regression to predict the width of fish based on features such as weight, length, and height. The model employs a polynomial degree of 2 and has been evaluated using cross-validation and metrics such as R² and MSE.

## **Tehnologies**
  * Python 3.x
  * Pandas
  * NumPy
  * Matplotlib
  * Scikit-learn

## **Evaluation**
The model achieved an R² of 0.96 on the test set, indicating good performance in predicting the fish width.
